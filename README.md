The ITC Hotels Revenue Optimization project leverages Power BI to deliver actionable insights into financial performance, occupancy trends, room category performance, and cancellations across the hotel chain. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of total revenue, ADR, RevPAR, and growth trends, highlighting top-performing hotels and room categories, as well as underperforming areas with untapped potential. Occupancy analysis revealed a 43% overall rate, signaling opportunities to improve demand through targeted promotions, marketing expansion, and weekday-focused campaigns. Booking analysis showed short lead times and a concentration of last-minute reservations, prompting recommendations for incentivizing early bookings. Cancellation analysis uncovered significant lost revenue, emphasizing the need for strategies to reduce booking drop-offs. The project combines advanced data visualization with strategic recommendations, enabling ITC Hotels to optimize pricing, boost occupancy, and maximize revenue potential
